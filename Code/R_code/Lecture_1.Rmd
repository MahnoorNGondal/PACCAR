# Introduction
In this lecture, we'll explore the basics of using R as a calculator. R is not just a programming language; it can also serve as a powerful calculator for performing mathematical operations.

## Arithmetic Operations
R supports standard arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Addition
```{r}
# Addition
result_addition <- 5 + 3
result_addition

```

# Subtraction
```{r}
result_subtraction <- 10 - 4
result_subtraction

```

# Multiplication
```{r}
result_multiplication <- 6 * 7
result_multiplication

```

# Division
```{r}
result_division <- 15 / 3
result_division
```

Exponentiation and Square Root

# Exponentiation
```{r}
result_exponentiation <- 2^3
result_exponentiation
```

# Square Root
```{r}
result_square_root <- sqrt(25)
result_square_root
```

```{r}



```
