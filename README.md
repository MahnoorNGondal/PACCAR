## Program Advancing Coding Comfort for Aspiring Biomedical Researchers (PACCAR)


Our organizationâ€™s general goal is to advance comfort with coding/programming among biomedical researchers. Current advancements in technology put biomedical researchers with understanding of coding at a large advantage in terms of job success and research yield. Without programming, researchers often need to resort to time-consuming and error-prone quantification methods that deter potentially influential research. However, university-level biology and related programs often do not enforce programming requirements, yielding graduate and even post-graduate researchers with minimal coding comfort. To combat this, we want to teach medical researchers or those considering that career field enough coding skills to create basic programs and be able to apply those skills to their research.
